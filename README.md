# 🧠 Machine Learning Project — Heta2-2

A machine learning notebook project using `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` to perform supervised learning on a structured dataset.

## 📁 Project Contents

- `heta2.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - 🔹 Data preprocessing
  - 🔹 Model training
  - 🔹 Evaluation & accuracy results
  - 🔹 Visualizations

## 🔍 What This Project Covers

- ✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing
- ✅ Train-test split using `train_test_split`
- ✅ Model selection using classifiers like `KNN`, `Decision Tree`, etc.
- ✅ Accuracy scoring and confusion matrix
- ✅ Visualization with `matplotlib`
